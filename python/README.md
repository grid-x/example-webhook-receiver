# openapi-client
This API describes the event webhook calling convention.
In order to receive webhook events from the gridX API, third parties must implement endpoints according to this specification. In the following, the external partner API is referred to as  \"external API\", while the gridX API is called \"gridX\".


This Python package is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project:

- API version: 1.0.0
- Package version: 1.0.0
- Build package: org.openapitools.codegen.languages.PythonClientCodegen

## Requirements.

Python 3.7+

## Installation & Usage
### pip install

If the python package is hosted on a repository, you can install directly using:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git
```
(you may need to run `pip` with root permission: `sudo pip install git+https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git`)

Then import the package:
```python
import openapi_client
```

### Setuptools

Install via [Setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools).

```sh
python setup.py install --user
```
(or `sudo python setup.py install` to install the package for all users)

Then import the package:
```python
import openapi_client
```

### Tests

Execute `pytest` to run the tests.

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:

```python

import time
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://external-api/gridx
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://external-api/gridx"
)



# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = openapi_client.WebhookReceiverApi(api_client)
    event_type = 'appliance/create' # str | The type of an event (e.g. 'appliance/offline'). The path depends on how the webhook has been configured and is not a hard requirement.
    x_signature = 'sha512=<signature>' # str | The value of this header can be used to authenticate the event payload and is in the format `<method>=<signature>`. - `method` must be \"sha512\" in any case. - `signature` is computed using the HMAC algorithm (as described in [RFC2104](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2104)) with SHA512 as hash function, with the request body as data and a pre-defined secret as key (that is only known between the external API and gridX). This is the same method as described in the W3C WebSub standard X-Hub-Signature, see: https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#authenticated-content-distribution 
    event = openapi_client.Event() # Event | The event's payload, partly depending on the event's type (see parameter eventType).

    try:
        # Webhook Receiver
        api_instance.events_event_type_post(event_type, x_signature, event)
    except ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling WebhookReceiverApi->events_event_type_post: %s\n" % e)

```
