# NodeJS/Express gridX Webhook Receiver Sample

This example implements a simple Express based server to receive events from gridX through webhooks.
It implements only the `appliance/online` event handler.

The implementation just prints the received event to the console.
You can work on the server while running it, every change will restart the server.

## Prerequisites

To run this server, you need to have `NodeJS` and `yarn` or `npm` installed.

## Usage

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```
